            <h5>Packaging Process</h5>
            <p>After the production of the dry construction concrete, we package it in bags that are easy to handle and transport.</p>
            <p>Our packaging process ensures that the products remain intact and are protected from environmental factors during transit.</p>
            <p>The packaging is done in small 25kg bags that are mannually done by labourers who mannually put the dry conrete in the bags and sew the mouth of the bag using the electrical sewing machine. </p>
